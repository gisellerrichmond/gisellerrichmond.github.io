### Skincare

I first discovered an interest in skincare in my sophomore year of highschool while on a mission to rid myself of acne. The more research I did into skincare, the more I found myself focusing on the scientific explanations of skincare relating to the intermolecular interactions of the ingredients with each other and with the skin.

Currenlty, I am pursuing this interest via continued hobby skincare research and am also searching for an opportunity to intern in the skincare/cosmetic formulation industry.

### Intercultural Communication

I've always wanted to spend some time living in another country within which I must learn a new language, learn a new set of cultural norms, and learn different ways of communicating. I grew up in an area of decent diversity and have always found myself drawn to friend groups of varied cultural backgrounds. Through these friend groups, I discovered appreciations for a variety of cultures among which is Korean culture. With my interest in skincare, and the Korean culture's exceptional value of skincare, I chose Korea as the destination of my life-long dream to live in another country.

Now I am set to study abroad in South Korea at Yonsei University for the 2022-23 academic year. During this experience, I hope to gain a plethera of useful communication experiences, a greater understanding of Korean culture specifically, and hopefully some experience with the Korean skincare industry.
